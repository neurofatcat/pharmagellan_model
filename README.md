# pharmagellan_model
Biotech valuation model based on Pharmagellan Guide Books

This is a simplified model that uses Yahoo Finanace to pull a publicly traded stock ticker and calculates the NPV of it's pipeline based on user assumptions. It then caculates a projected market cap and share price based on the current float. 

This is not meant to be investment advice. Always do your own research.
